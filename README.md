# DSA
### Hey there! This is my dsa vault, a few files may contain multiple implementation methods that I wrote just out of curiosity.
😎Don't take my code seriously, I try everything and anything(rational ofcourse), all the possibilities,😏 like seriously I test the boundaries of python(mostly) and sometimes with Java too.
I try the different ways I can get my code working, 🙄😇you can check the code if you are cool with experimentations.!!!AT YOUR OWN RISK ;)!!!
